== Introduction

Divvun's primary supported method for installing spell checking and other supported tools is via https://divvun.org[Divvun Manager]. The instructions below are for enterprise usage only.

It is the responsibility of the system administrators to manage installation and updates of these services and tool themselves. If you require automatic update management, use https://divvun.org[Divvun Manager].

== Instructions

=== Installing resources

IMPORTANT: WinDivvun must be installed prior to installing any of the spell checking languages.

To silently install the resources, the recommended flags are `/VERYSILENT /SP- /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART`. The installer flags are documented on the https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline[Inno Setup website].

1. Run the WinDivvun installer with the relevant flags.
2. Run the language resource installer(s) with the relevant flags.

=== Confirming successful installation and testing

. Open Microsoft Word
. Change the language of the document to the language(s) you have installed. The examples below use North Sami.
